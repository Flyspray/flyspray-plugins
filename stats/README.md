Flyspray currently has only 'activity' bars, the event log view and the roadmap view.

For people who can generate statistics from SQL databases it is no problem to do much more useful things.

This extension integrates some more statistics into Flyspray:

* A chart of when tasks where created and closed.
  Currently only used the first created and the last time it was closed, so intermediate status closed-reopened are not visible.
