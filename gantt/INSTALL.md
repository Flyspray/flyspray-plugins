## INSTALL

1. Copy gantt.tpl to your flyspray/**themes/CleanFS/templates/** directory
2. Copy gantt.php to your flyspray/**scripts/** directory

When installed, Gantt view can be enabled on project level. In the project's **Preferences->General** toggle 'Enable Gantt view'. 

Flyspray-rc10 or newer is aware of this extension so there is nothing more to do.
