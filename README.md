Extensions or Experiments that are not (yet) part of Flyspray

Well, Flyspray yet has no real plugin system and will not get some in short future. (2022-2023 at least)

So stuff here are just files that can be added to a Flyspray installation if you want to have such additional features.

These are **complete experimental** and may be dumped if useless or replaced by better solutions or are finally integrated into Flyspray main source.

They are meant to work with latest Flyspray release (https://github.com/Flyspray/flyspray/releases) and/or git master branch. They **may** just work with older releases by luck.
